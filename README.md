a. What server framework did you choose and why?
ans: I choose NODEJS for my server side because of built-in 
support for package management using the NPM tool that comes 
by default with every Node.js installation, which makes the coding really easy and organised.

b. What client framework did you choose and why?
ans: I did my client side code in JQUERY because it allows the web developer to make sure that
all the JavaScript functioning works exactly the same across all the browsers.

c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
ans: server framework was the easy part of the implementation as using EXPRESS module from nodejs provides
the template for the server.

d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
ans: I find the client side hard while implementing as it was a new thing for me, using JSON data and AJAX call.
so i have researched on that and then implemented it. But after learning about it all seems pretty handy.
 
e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install,
if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
ans: Other components used:
1.) I have used google maps API for implementing maps on my website.
2.) I have downloaded git Bash for pushing my project to the reprository.
3.) I have downloaded heroku toolbelt for windows to deploy my webapp on heroku. 

f. What Ubuntu commands are required to deploy and run your server?
ans: $ heroku login
     $ git clone https://github.com/rahulsingh08436/cse5335-project-1
     $ cd cse5335-project-1
     $ heroku create 
     $ git push heroku master
     $ heroku open
